This repository gathers a selection of projects illustrating my background in superconducting electronics, quantum hardware, mechanical devices, precision mechatronics and embedded systems.  
Most files are short slide decks or concise reports intended for quick review in the context of graduate applications and research positions.

## 1. Reconfigurable Superconducting Nanowire Coincidence Detection

**Type:** Research paper / extended report  
**Keywords:** superconducting nanowires, nTron logic, SNSPDs, coincidence detection, cryogenic circuits  
**File:** `Reconfigurable_Superconducting_Nanowire_Coincidence_Detection.pdf`

This work presents a reconfigurable superconducting nanowire logic gate that implements both XOR- and AND-like behavior for photon-coincidence detection. The circuit is driven by superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) and based on nTron devices acting as current-controlled switches. We experimentally demonstrate correct gate operation at cryogenic temperature, characterize the bias margins, and extract bit-error rates around \(10^{-3}\). This circuit is relevant for on-chip Bell-state measurements, quantum communication protocols, and more broadly for cryogenic digital processing tightly integrated with SNSPDs.

## 2. Master’s Thesis Presentation (MIT / ETH Zurich)

**Type:** Research presentation (slides)  
**Keywords:** superconducting nanowire circuits, reconfigurable logic, quantum nanofabrication, cryogenic electronics  
**File:** `Masters_Thesis_Presentation.pdf`

This slide deck summarizes my master’s thesis work carried out as a visiting student at the Quantum Nanostructures and Nanofabrication Group (MIT), in collaboration with ETH Zurich. The project focuses on the design, nanofabrication and characterization of superconducting nanowire logic circuits (nTron-based) and their integration with SNSPDs. The presentation provides an overview of the device concepts, GDS layout generation, experimental setup at cryogenic temperature, and preliminary performance metrics.

## 3. Diaxxo Medtech Project – Automated PCR Device

**Type:** Hardware / mechatronics project (slides)  
**Keywords:** medtech, automated dispensing, mechatronics, control electronics, rapid diagnostics  
**File:** `Diaxxo_Project.pdf`

In this project, I worked at Diaxxo, a medtech startup developing rapid PCR diagnostic devices. I was responsible for designing and prototyping an automated system for handling and dispensing wax into PCR cartridges, combining mechanical design, actuation, sensing and control electronics. The slides present the system architecture, mechanical layouts, control strategies, and experimental validation, illustrating my ability to take a complex hardware subsystem from concept to functional prototype in an industrial environment.

## 4. Flexure-Based 2-DOF Mirror Scanner for Femtosecond Laser Micromachining

**Type:** Mechanical design project (report or slides)  
**Keywords:** flexure mechanisms, 2-DOF scanner, femtosecond laser processing, dynamic balancing, precision mechatronics  
**File:** `High-Speed_2-DOF_Mirror_Scanner_Femtosecond_Laser_Processing.pdf`

This project describes the design and sizing of a flexure-based two-degree-of-freedom mirror scanner for femtosecond laser micromachining. The mirror is mounted on a gimbal mechanism guided by flexure joints and dynamically balanced to minimize parasitic reactions. The report covers kinematic modelling, Grübler mobility analysis, stress and fatigue constraints in flexure hinges, as well as key performance metrics such as maximum scanning frequency, angular resolution, acceleration and jerk. Construction and material choices (largely monolithic titanium with added counterweights) are justified with respect to dynamic performance and manufacturability.

## 5. Microcontroller and Digital Systems Project (EPFL)

**Type:** Embedded systems project (report + code)  
**Keywords:** Atmega128L, assembly, embedded C, 1-Wire sensor, LCD, motor control, user interface  
**File:** `Project_Microcontrollers_and_Digital_Systems.pdf`

As part of the “Microcontrollers and Digital Systems” course, I implemented an embedded control system on an Atmega128L microcontroller (STK-300 board) using assembly. The application emulates a small skewer oven: it reads temperature from a 1-Wire digital sensor, displays the real-time and reference temperature on an LCD, drives a motor for skewer rotation when the setpoint is reached, and plays a short melody at the end of the cooking cycle. The project demonstrates low-level programming (interrupts, timers, I/O), hardware interfacing, and the design of a simple but complete user-facing embedded system.

## 6. Nanosystems Literature Review (ETH Zurich)

**Type:** Literature review & seminar presentation  
**Keywords:** Single-electron transistor, CdSe nanocrystal, Coulomb blockade, quantum transport, nanoscale electronics  
**File:** `Review-SET_Nanosystems.pdf`

As part of the “Nanosystems” course, I prepared a literature review on a single-electron transistor based on a cadmium selenide (CdSe) nanocrystal. I summarized the device structure, operating principle (Coulomb blockade and charge quantization), and fabrication approach, and discussed its main limitations and potential applications in ultra-low-power electronics. The project culminated in a written report and an in-class seminar presenting the state of the art to my peers.

## How to Use This Repository
